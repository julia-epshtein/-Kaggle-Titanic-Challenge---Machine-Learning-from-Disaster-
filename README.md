# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Setting Up and Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/julia-epshtein/-Kaggle-Titanic-Challenge---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   ## To install Jax follow these steps:
   - Create a new Conda environment: conda create -n jax_env
   - Activate the new environment: conda activate jax_env
   - Install Jax in the Conda environment using the following command: conda install -c conda-forge jax
   - Install matplotlib in the environment using: conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
   
   ## NumPy and Pandas
   pip install numpy
   
   ## Tensorflow
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   - Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data preprocessing and model implementation.

4. **Explore Results:**
   - Check the accuracy table in the README or explore the generated visualizations and predictions.

5. **Submit Predictions to Kaggle:**
   - If desired, follow the Kaggle submission guidelines provided in the notebooks or scripts to submit predictions.

## Introduction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features. The dataset includes information about passengers, such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, embarked port, and cabin information. The primary objective is to create a predictive model capable of accurately determining whether a passenger survived or not.
